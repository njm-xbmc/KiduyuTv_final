## Overview

KiduyuTV is a production-ready streaming application that delivers a premium viewing experience across Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, and mobile devices. Built with modern Android development practices using Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3, the app provides a Netflix-style interface with smooth D-pad navigation for television remotes and intuitive touch interactions for mobile devices.

The application integrates with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to provide real-time access to extensive movie and television content, enhanced by curated collections hosted on GitHub. With intelligent caching powered by Room database, users enjoy seamless offline access to previously viewed content while maintaining fresh data synchronization.

KiduyuTV supports multiple streaming formats including HLS adaptive streaming through Media3 ExoPlayer, YouTube video playback, and WebView-based content. The app implements a dual-platform strategy through build flavors, generating optimized variants for both television and mobile experiences from a single codebase.

---

## Features

### Dual-Platform Experience

KiduyuTV provides optimized interfaces for both television and mobile platforms, automatically detecting the device type at runtime and applying the appropriate navigation patterns and UI layouts. The television interface features D-pad focus management with visual focus indicators, while the mobile interface leverages touch gestures and swipe navigation for fluid content browsing.

### Content Discovery

The home screen presents a dynamic hero section showcasing featured content with backdrop images and smooth transitions. Below the hero, content rows organized by category enable horizontal scrolling through curated collections. Users can browse by production company, television network, genre, or curated themes, with intelligent search functionality supporting both movies and TV shows.

### Curated Collections

KiduyuTV includes twelve pre-configured content categories spanning diverse genres and themes. Oscar Winners 2026 showcases recent award-winning films, while Hallmark Movies provides family-friendly holiday content. Action enthusiasts can explore the Jason Statham Collection, and fans of science fiction can dive into Time Travel movies and TV shows. Additional collections include Best Classics, Best Sitcoms, Spy Thrillers, True Stories, Christian Movies and TV Shows, Bible Movies, and Doctor Who Specials.

### Streaming Playback

The application supports multiple playback mechanisms for diverse content types. Media3 ExoPlayer handles HLS adaptive bitrate streaming with intelligent quality selection based on network conditions. YouTube videos play natively through the YouTube Android Player library, while WebView-based playback serves as a fallback for embedded content from various sources. The stream links screen aggregates available sources for content that may be distributed across multiple providers.

### Personalization

User personalization features include watch history tracking with automatic position restoration for seamless continuation of interrupted viewing sessions. The My List feature enables users to save favorites for quick access, with data persisted locally using Room database and synchronized to Firebase for signed-in users. Watch history enrichment automatically updates metadata from TMDB to ensure even historical items display current poster images and complete information.

### Modern Architecture

The application implements Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers. The MVVM pattern with Kotlin Flow manages reactive state updates, while the Repository pattern provides centralized data access with intelligent caching strategies. Room database enables offline-first functionality with configurable cache expiration periods.

## Architecture

KiduyuTV follows Clean Architecture principles with three distinct layers that ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

### Data Layer

The data layer handles all external and local data operations through the repository pattern. The `TmdbRepository` class coordinates API calls to The Movie Database, managing request execution, response caching, and error handling. Room database entities store cached content with expiration timestamps, enabling automatic cache invalidation and offline access. The GitHub-hosted content fetcher retrieves curated lists using a dedicated OkHttp client configured for larger payload handling with DNS-over-HTTPS support.

### Domain Layer

Business logic resides in ViewModels that manage UI state and coordinate between the data and presentation layers. The `HomeViewModel` orchestrates parallel loading of content from multiple sources using coroutines and async operations, while individual ViewModels handle specific features including search, detail views, and media playback. State management uses Kotlin Flow for reactive updates throughout the application.

### Presentation Layer

The UI layer implements screens and components using Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3 theming. Reusable composables handle common patterns including content rows with lazy loading, hero sections with dynamic backdrop transitions, and network logo displays. The navigation system uses typed routes with arguments for type-safe screen transitions, while platform-specific navigation graphs handle television and mobile interaction patterns independently.

## Configuration

### TMDB API Setup

KiduyuTV uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API for all movie and TV show data. The API configuration is managed in the `ApiClient.kt` file within the data layer. For production deployment, replace the placeholder token with your own TMDB API key obtained from [TMDB API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

```kotlin
// In ApiClient.kt
companion object {
    private const val TMDB_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
}
```

### Firebase Configuration

The app integrates with Firebase services for analytics, authentication, and data synchronization. Place your `google-services.json` file in the `app/` directory. This file is downloaded from the Firebase Console and contains your project-specific configuration including API keys and application IDs.

### AdMob / Ad Manager

Advertising is configured through the manifest metadata. For production, update the application ID in `AndroidManifest.xml` with your own AdMob application ID from the Google AdMob console.

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
    android:value="ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxx~xxxxxxxx"/>
```

### Content Lists

Curated content lists are stored as JSON files in the `/lists` directory and hosted on GitHub for easy updates without app releases. Each list contains TMDB movie or TV show IDs with pre-fetched metadata for efficient batch loading.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 12345,
    "title": "Movie Title",
    "overview": "Movie description...",
    "posterPath": "/poster.jpg",
    "backdropPath": "/backdrop.jpg",
    "voteAverage": 8.5,
    "releaseDate": "2025-01-15",
    "genreIds": [28, 12, 878],
    "popularity": 150.234
  }
]
```

To create custom content lists, add JSON files to the repository under `/lists` and update the URLs in `HomeViewModel.kt`.
